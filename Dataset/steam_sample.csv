1198550,game,Moderium,1198550,0,False,"Moderium is a Wave-Based Isometric Action Role-Playing Game (ARPG) where players are given vast customization over their combat capabilities through the unique Modification system. Players will enter various realms and fight back waves of enemies of varying power to gain experience and equipment to further their abilities. The difficulty encountered is at the hands of the player through manually setting the initial level of enemies to fight which allows for more casual or edge-of-seat gameplay. With 10 Classes, 4 Skill Trees, 52 Skills and 59 Sets available at launch the path of which you choose to defeat your enemies is up to you.<br><br>Moderium focuses around the concept of customization while retaining accessibility without removing depth of gameplay.<br><br>	<strong><u>Feature Summary</u></strong><br>- Customizable skills to play as you choose.<br>- Randomly generated equipment with the opportunity to target crafting specific pieces.<br>- New Secondary Stats to offer meaningful equipment management and build diversity.<br>- Class variety with gameplay impact.<br>- Roguelike and Incremental elements to allow rewards for time commitment while furthering character development beyond max level.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------<br><br>	<strong><u>Features Detailed</u></strong><br>						<strong><u>SKILLS</u></strong><br>Each skill is composed of the Base Skill, 5 Modifiers and 2 Stages. This allows for a diverse approach to combat. Leveling grants a skill point, which can be used to unlock and modify the effect of a skill. As 5 points are allocated into a skill the Second Stage is unlocked, adding a passive benefit to the skill, after 10 points the skill's Third Stage is unlocked. One player may use Fireball to light enemies on fire, dealing damage over time; while another may use Fireball to regenerate mana on impact. Of course a third individual may choose to go all out with a Fireball that pierces enemies, regenerating mana, lighting enemies on fire and creating more Fireballs (called Fractures) on impact.<br><br>In addition to the customization found within each skill several skills within the same way will interact with one another if the player so chooses.

Players will enter various realms and fight back waves of enemies of varying power to gain experience and equipment to further their abilities. The difficulty encountered is at the hands of the player through manually setting the initial level of enemies to fight which allows for more casual or edge-of-seat gameplay. With 10 Classes, 4 Skill Trees, 52 Skills and 59 Sets available at launch the path of which you choose to defeat your enemies is up to you.<br><br>Moderium focuses around the concept of customization while retaining accessibility without removing depth of gameplay.<br><br>	<strong><u>Feature Summary</u></strong><br>- Customizable skills to play as you choose.<br>- Randomly generated equipment with the opportunity to target crafting specific pieces.<br>- New Secondary Stats to offer meaningful equipment management and build diversity.<br>- Class variety with gameplay impact.<br>- Roguelike and Incremental elements to allow rewards for time commitment while furthering character development beyond max level.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------<br><br>	<strong><u>Features Detailed</u></strong><br>						<strong><u>SKILLS</u></strong><br>Each skill is composed of the Base Skill, 5 Modifiers and 2 Stages. This allows for a diverse approach to combat. Leveling grants a skill point, which can be used to unlock and modify the effect of a skill. As 5 points are allocated into a skill the Second Stage is unlocked, adding a passive benefit to the skill, after 10 points the skill's Third Stage is unlocked. One player may use Fireball to light enemies on fire, dealing damage over time; while another may use Fireball to regenerate mana on impact.

1198820,game,Monster Girl Garden,1198820,0,False,"Welcome to Monster Girl Garden, the interactive life simulation/ monster battling hentai game! The game is currently in Beta.<br />
<br />
You are granted a dejected piece of land in the forest to attract the the world's monster girls. Clear your land, upgrade your tools, craft new decorations, and more! Attract visitors, &quot;convince&quot; them to stay, battle and breed them with others to create the strongest, or sexiest possible girl.<br />
<br />
Once you've attracted a new monster and convinced them to stay it's time to train them up. Monster girls do what they want and it's hard to control them, they will wander the garden and do what they feel like. Currently the game allows you to assign Commands right from the start, but in future updates this will require raising their 'Loyalty' stat. Loyalty shows how much your monster likes you, and is a reflection of how well you are treating them.<br />
<br />
Plenty of animations and scenes will be added as the game expands over time. Girls have a lust stat which raises over time and must be satisfied. If they can't find a willing partner they may engage a not so willing monster, or deal with it themselves. Or you can always switch to Player Mode and help them out yourself! Player Mode allows you to explore your Garden in 3rd person and interact with your Monsters ;)<br />
Some monsters have alternate skins which can be unlocked, and more will be added in future updates.","Welcome to Monster Girl Garden, the interactive life simulation/ monster battling hentai game! The game is currently in Beta.<br />
