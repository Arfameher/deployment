### Description
To visualize some interesting aspects about this scraped steam data. Here is a json file containing data on some 4000 odd games sold on the popular digital games storefront steam. Performing data cleaning, exploration and visualization on the given dataset in jupyter notebook and deploy a web page showing an interactive model on heroku. 

Objectives of the Project :

### Installation
Before running this code you need to have anaconda installed in your system and jupyter notebook running with basic libraries or Python IDE such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

To run this code you have to clone the repository or download it as a zip file and run it. But before that we need to install some libraries to run this code.

- Create virtual environment to run this code. 
    - If you are using anaconda --> `conda create -n <yourenvname> python=x.x anaconda`
    - Activate your virtual environment -->
    `conda activate <yourenvname>`

- Now we will have to download libraries that are specifically used for this code to run and to read and write a GeoTiff file or a shape file. All these libraries are written in reuirements.txt file.
To install all these libraries do the folling steps:

    1. cd to the directory where `requirements.txt` is located
    2. run the command in your shell: 
        ```javascript
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ``` 

Once you are through with the installation

### Timeline
Dec 2021

Time limit: 2 weeks --> 15/12/2021 - 27/12/2021 

This is a solo project given to us at [BeCode](https://becode.org/) after completion of our study material related to deployment where we learnt how to use `flask`, `docker` and `heroku`.
I would like to further improve this project by doing more analysis on the dataset.

### Personal Situation
This is a solo project given to me at [BeCode](https://becode.org/)
I am currently aspiring to be a Data Scientist. This is a Deployment project where I have used python library such as Flask to create my webpage and deployed it using docker and heroku.
